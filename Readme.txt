Soloteach is education website for teacher to manager their student and manage their time to improve their working efficiency. This website was built with Flask and Python.
We can find their are several modules in the whole website which involves profile, student, tuition, calendar, class.

（Important What I Learned And Career Direction）

Throughout this project, I developed a wide range of practical and transferable skills.

I strengthened my ability to manage time effectively, plan development stages, and handle project workflows.  
I also built foundational skills in market research, information searching, self-directed learning, and the development, testing, and maintenance of code.

Most importantly, I learned how to use AI responsibly as a tool for learning and growth rather than as a shortcut.

This project helped me clarify my long-term career direction.  
One path I am highly interested in is software development and engineering.  
Another area that strongly attracts me is artificial intelligence.

In university, I hope to study machine learning and AI-related technologies in order to automate and more precisely solve real-world problems for specific user groups.

In addition, I want to continue building a stronger and more comprehensive knowledge framework.  
I hope to develop my interdisciplinary abilities in a more structured way, because I believe future careers will increasingly require composite and cross-disciplinary talents.

This is also one of the key reasons why I chose a comprehensive university.  
My goal is to improve my overall capabilities in a well-rounded environment and establish a solid foundation for my future career development.

 Motivation

There are many independent teachers across different fields.  
They work with a large number of students, but often lack a unified tool to manage student information and an intuitive scheduling system to organize their time and courses.

They need an integrated management system to centrally manage students’ schedules, courses, tuition, and personal information.

I regularly communicate with trainee teachers to better understand the industry and its real-world pain points.

Although this is my first project, I take it very seriously.  
My goal is to build a practical tool to help the target audience solve real problems.  
I conducted market research and found that there are currently no highly targeted and cost-effective tools in this space.

Therefore, I chose to develop this project while learning, continuously refining it based on real user needs.



Learning Process & Technical Approach

After defining the overall direction of the project, I entered a stage of intensive self-directed learning.  
Foundational concepts such as Flask project structure and Blueprints were essential prerequisites.

After exploring a wide range of online learning resources, including Coursera and Udemy, I compared different programming languages and frontend–backend frameworks.  
Ultimately, I decided to build the backend using Python with a Flask-based project structure, and the frontend using standard HTML and CSS integrated with Flask forms.

I also planned to learn Figma to design initial wireframes for user interaction and interface planning.



Engineering Mindset & Development Process

Before this stage, I completed a full-stack engineering course on Coursera, which helped me understand the overall workflow of web development and provided a clear structural framework for this project.

While still attending school, I spent two to three months studying relevant online courses and simultaneously preparing key project documents, including:

- Data structure design  
- Page–function mapping  
- Role-based permission descriptions  
- Overall website architecture  
- A detailed Flask project structure plan  

This significantly strengthened my ability to decompose a complex project into manageable stages and refine each stage through structured thinking.

For example, when implementing tuition calculation, I divided the task into frontend and backend components, and further refined each part into backend logic, frontend structure, and CSS styling.



Responsible Use of AI

During development, I sometimes sought support from AI tools such as ChatGPT.

When I felt stuck, I first asked the AI to outline the overall framework and key knowledge points.  
Then, I researched those topics through documentation and courses and attempted my own implementation.  
After that, I used AI for debugging—asking it what was wrong, why it was wrong, and how to improve it.

The most important lesson I learned was how to use AI responsibly as a tool for growth rather than a shortcut.



Reflection & Time Management

I established a clear timeline for each stage of development and maintained a dedicated development log to record challenges and obstacles.

By reviewing these logs, I was able to evaluate my progress, identify areas for improvement, and adjust future plans more thoughtfully.

This habit strengthened my time management skills and encouraged continuous self-reflection.
